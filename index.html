      <h2>The Art of Coffee: From Bean to Cup</h2>
      
      <p>
        Coffee is more than just a beverage—it's a culture, a ritual, and a way of
        life. From the lush coffee farms to the steaming cup in your hands, every
        step of the journey matters. In this post, let’s explore the world of
        coffee, its origins, and why it’s worth savoring <em>every sip</em> .
      </p>
      <h3>What is Coffee?</h3>
      <p>
        Coffee is a beloved drink made from roasted coffee beans, which are the
        seeds of the Coffea plant. It’s one of the most popular beverages in the
        world, known for its rich flavor and energizing effects. But coffee is
        more than just a drink—it’s a story. Each cup tells a tale of the soil it
        grew in, the hands that harvested it, and the craft of brewing it to
        perfection.

        on a coffee plant. The beans are extracted, dried, and roasted to
        perfection.
